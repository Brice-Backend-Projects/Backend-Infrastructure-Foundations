# Python Typing â€” Module Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Briefly explain what this module covers.  
*This module will use the library `mypy` to anaylze a simple function with hints that passes an incorrect argument type.*

## ðŸ§ª Experiments & Demos

List scripts, notebooks, or demos here with a 1â€“2 sentence description.

- `add_demo.py` â†’ Compare add function with `int` vs. `str`.  
- `add_test.py` â†’ Test function with incorrect types.
- `error_handle_add_test.py` -> Rewrites the function with proper error handling.  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results / Findings

The file, `add_demo.py` included several functions to observe behavior.  The following functions were created: 
- add_int(a,b)
- add_str(a,b)
- add_error(a,b)

The functions passed an int, str, and a combo of int/str, respectively.  The int added number, the str concantenated the string variables and the error threw a "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'".  

Running the file through `mypy` library yielded the following:
`add_demo.py:10: error: Argument 1 to "add_str" has incompatible type "int"; expected "str"  [arg-type]
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)`
This result is telling the user that the types of arguments passed to the functions mismatch the expected data types required for the function.
